## Let's add the streamlit apps here

### For example Streamlit app 1: Tiktoken

The idea for this directory is to have the streamlit apps to test locally. We can also use this directory to test the streamlit apps in the cloud.

## Streamlit

To add streamlit use:

python -m pip install streamlit

To run the app use:

streamlit run main.py
